Client-VPN Message documentation
1. Overview 
This application is a simple VPN server and client that communicates with each other to execute 2 operations: shifting right and converting time zone. 
- Shifting right: takes a string input and replace each character in this string with the next one in ASCII table.
- Converting time zone: is used for converting time from one timezone to another one using pytz library from Python
2. Client – server message format 
<operation_type> <message_content>
Note: 
- operation_type are only shift_right and convert_timezone. They are not case sensitive.
- message_content: input string for each operation
- Example:
o Converting time zone:  CONVERT_TIMEZONE <date> <time> <from_timezone> <to_timezone>
* CONVERT_TIMEZONE 2024-10-19 12:00:00 UTC America/New_York
o Shifting right: shift_right <input_string>
* shift_right abc
3. Server-client message format 
Received response: <output_string>
4.  Example input – output
a. Converting time zone:
- Input: CONVERT_TIMEZONE 2024-10-19 12:00:00 UTC America/New_York
- Output: Received response: '2024-10-19 08:00:00' [19 bytes]
b. Shifting right:
- Input: shift_right abc 
- Output: Received response: 'bcd' [3 bytes]
5. Description of network layers
- Application layer: encodes and decodes the message received from the client 
- Transport layer: establishes reliable communication using TCP 
- Link layer: handle data transmission
